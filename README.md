-->Poster on Color Quantization using Median-Cut Algorithm.\
-->Color Quantization is a process that reduces the number of distinct colors used in an image, usually with the intention that the new image should be as visually similar as possible to the original image.\
-->Python Code of Color Quantization using Median-Cut Algorithm.\
-->Outputs of the Code.
## ClassAssignment1
Task1-->Read a color image and convert it into gray scale image without using inbulit function(i.e do it by average method(R+G+B)/3)).\
Task2-->Convert the pixel of gray scale image to either 1 or 0.\
Task3-->Add gray image and image with pixels either 1 or 0 and add 20 to gray scale image.\
Perform the task and display the output images.
## ClassAssignment2
Task-->Read a color image,convert the color image to gray scale and dispaly both images.\
Make some part of that gray scale image total black and display it.Now subtract this to images andd display output image.
## ClassAssignment3
Task-->Create two images one with a white circle at center and another with a white rentangle at center and perform\
all logical gate operations on both images and display the output images. 
## ClassAssignment4
Task---> Read a color image and display its reddish,greenisg and bluish image.
## ClassAssignment5
Task-->Read a color image,convert the color image to gray scale and perform histogram equalization by algorithm discussed in class(i.e of wikipedia site).
also check with direct function avaialable.
## ClassAssignment6
Task-->Read a color image,convert the color image to gray scale and do contrast maniplution.\
display output images.\
-----------------Contrast Manipulation-------------------\
to increase contrast we multiple image with a constant, greater than one.\
to decrease contrast we multiple image with a constant, lesser than one.\
## ClassAssignment7
---------------------Bit Plane Slicing--------------------------\
Bit plane slicing is a method of representing an image with one or more bits of the byte used for each pixel. One can use only MSB to represent the pixel, which reduces the original gray level to a binary image. \
The three main goals of bit plane slicing is:\
--Converting a gray level image to a binary image.\
--Representing an image with fewer bits and corresponding the image to a smaller size\
--Enhancing the image by focussing.
## ClassAssignment8
-->Contrast maniplulation of the Color image
## ClassAssignment9
-->Shannon Fano Coding : Shannon Fano Algorithm is an entropy encoding technique for lossless data compression of multimedia.it assigns a code to each symbol based on their probabilities of occurrence. It is a variable-length encoding scheme, that is, the codes assigned to the symbols will be of varying length. 
## ClassAssignment10
-->Huffman coding is a lossless data compression technique. Huffman coding is based on the frequency of occurrence of a data item i.e. pixel in images. The technique is to use a lower number of bits to encode the data in to binary codes that occurs more frequently. It is used in JPEG files.
## ClassAssignment11
-------------------------Histogram Streching---------------------------------------------
-->There are two methods of enhancing contrast. The first one is called Histogram stretching that increase contrast.
